# About me
Well, I am just a high school student in China, I like do works about computer or coding.

I truly like coding in my free time.One of the reason is that I can practice my logical thinking skills, the other is that I can have joy when I learn something new!

Ok, that's enough. <u>Fight for the future!</u>
